Recently I've been wanting to create my own personal site. The reasons for this are primarily to share projects I'm working on and create a sort of simple portfolio, along with some blogging about the projects I'm working on. 

It took a bit of research to find the best option on how to implement this in regards to my use case. I decided fairly early on that I only wanted to create static sites, so my best bet was most likely some form of static site generator. The first option I explored was to create the site using org-mode in emacs. There's a variety of different generators for this method, along with simply just creating your own, however at the time I determined it was a bit too much work for the amount of time I wanted to put into the setup of this site.

I eventually stumbled upon jekyll while looking into github pages (which is currently being used to host the site), which does what I need to do with less initial time investment. Posts and pages are written using markdown, which I already have experience using. 

At the moment the site only uses the defaults provided by jekyll, although in the future I might try and create my own theme. Other future goals for the site include setting up a project page to display projects I've worked on.
